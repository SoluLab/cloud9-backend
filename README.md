## **Hardhat Setup**

This project demonstrates an hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with two contracts: c9 token & c9 ico contract, a test for those contract, scripts to deploy those contract on matic testnet, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/c9Token.js
npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/c9ICO.js
npx hardhat verify --network mumbai DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "CloudNine"
npx hardhat verify --network mumbai DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "CloudNineICO"
```
